A Wolfram|Alpha® OS X menu bar app.

## To-do

### For now
- [ ] Error for blank results, with link to WolframAlpha.com search
  - [ ] For more complicated queries, display the result but also a link to the W|A search.
- [ ] Support for sub/superscript (e.g.: C_8H_10N_4O_2, x^3)
- [ ] Allow text box to be selectable with ⌘A, copiable with ⌘C, etc.
- [ ] Support for looking at different unit conversions for the same result easily
- [ ] Support for multiple responses (*"define set"*)

### For later
- [ ] Make it look good
